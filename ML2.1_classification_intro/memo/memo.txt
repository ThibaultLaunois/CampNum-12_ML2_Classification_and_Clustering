1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ?
Check the balance
b) categorical features ? 
Use a HotOneEncoder for features with few classes.
Replace Nan values either with Unknow or most_frequent, etc ...
c) continuous features ?
replace nan values
standardize

2) Confusion matrix:
a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?
5 FP
b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
12 FN

3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 

b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?



4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? 

b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?
